> Execution context is a concept in the language,
equates to the 'environment' a function executes in; that is, variable
scope (and the scope chain, variables in closures from outer scopes),
function arguments, and the value of `this` object.

> The `call stack` is a collection of execution contexts.

> Execution ctx = scope chain + function args + this
